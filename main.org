The challenge of optimizing Perovskite performance is one with many
facets. Almost every detail of a Perovskite crystal's structure and
chemistry effects its performance as a semiconductor. The size of the
unit cell effects its substrate affinity and in turn its carrier
concentrations [[cite:&jiang-2006-predic-lattic]]. The crystal's phase
effects many aspects of the electronic structure, including the band
gap and optical response. Of course, these qualities of a structure
are largely dependent on the specification, proportions and
arrangements of the constituent elements.

We report a synthetic dataset collected for 495 chemically distinct,
pseudo cubic Halide Perovskites. This dataset builds on that of 229
samples which formed the foundation of the prior work by
[[citet:&mannodi-kanakkithodi-2021-data-driven-new]]. The [[acrshort:dft][DFT]] computed
properties we collected and the levels of theory used are discussed in
ref:methodology. The relatively large size of this dataset is intended
to provide an initial sampling suitable for guiding exploration of the
alloy space. Structural information is considered constant to better
focus on obtaining physically meaningful interpretations of models
dealing only with information derived from a sample composition.

The dataset we report is based on standard cubic phase ABX_3
Perovskite structures obtained from public databases. Fourteen common
Perovskite constituents are selected to form our Halide Perovskite
composition space ref:fig:outline. Five constituents including
[[acrfull:ma][Methylammonium (MA)]] and [[acrfull:fa][Formamidinium (FA)]] cations represent the
possible A-site occupants. Six metals represent the possible B-site
occupants. Three halides represent the possible X-site occupants. In
total, these component vectors form a constrained 14 dimensional space
(Figure ref:fig:chemspace_uni) within which all Perovskite compounds
consisting of the elements in Figure ref:fig:outline (a) must exist.

The pure (non-alloyed) possibilities are exhaustively sampled using
\(5*6*3 = 90\) Perovskites. Based on these pure Perovskite structures,
we mix candidates for A, B, and X sites systematically. The alloy
space sees combinatorial scaling and must be sparsely sampled
ref:fig:sample_map.

To generate site-mixing structures with high representativeness,
[[acrfull:sqs][special quasi-random structures (SQS)]] are applied. The [[acrshort:sqs][SQS]] method is
to build a special periodic structure and make the first
nearest-neighbor shells as similar to the target random alloy as
possible. The [[acrshort:sqs][SQS]] can be considered as the best possible periodic unit
cell representing a given random alloy.

Each computational run is performed using a 2x2x2 supercell, this
allows A and B site doping to be modeled in discrete 1/8^th fractions
of the total site occupancy, and it allows X site doping to be modeled
in 1/24^th fractions. At these mixing levels, it is appropriate to
call all these Perovskites alloys.

following the process above, 126 A-site mixing samples, 151 B-site
mixing samples and 127 X-site mixing samples are generated. All
resulting structures are optimized using a [[acrshort:dft][DFT]] variable-cell
relaxation under [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]]. These same initial structures also underwent a
full [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] relaxation to help ensure the validity of the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]]
relaxations, however this was only computationally tractable for 299
samples.

DFT calculations are performed with [[gls:vasp][VASP]] version 6.2. The [[acrlong:paw][projector
augmented wave]] potentials were used as pseudopotentials. The
generalized gradient approximation [[acrlong:gga][generalized gradient approximation]]
of [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] and the hybrid [[acrshort:hse][HSE]]06 (\alpha=0.25 and \omega=0.2) functionals
are used as exchange-correlation energy. The energy cutoff for the
plane-wave basis is set to 500 eV. For [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] the Brillouin zone was
sampled by 6x6x6 reciprocal mesh using the Monkhorst-Pack k-point
mesh. For [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] the Brillouin zone was sampled by 2x2x2 reciprocal
mesh using the Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh. The structural force
convergence threshold is set to be 0.005 eV/\AA.

The decomposition energy indicates the stability of a compound. To
calculate the decomposition energy for an ABX3 Perovskite, we assume
it will decompose to two phases, AX and BX2. Using [[acrshort:dft][DFT]] calculations,
we can get the optimized energy of a Perovskite and that of its
constituent phases. The decomposition energy is calculated using
equation eqref:eq:decoE. This calculation is performed separately for
each level of theory.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:decoE}
E_{decomp} = E_{opt}(ABX_3) - E_{opt}(AX) - E_{opt}(BX2)

The [[gls:slme][SLME]] metric developed by [[citet:&yu-2012-ident-poten]] is used
as the primary criterion screening perovskites for their photovoltaic
merits. The [[gls:slme][SLME]] value is computed considering a 5\mu{}m absorption
layer for every Perovskite according to eqref:eq:slme.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:slme}

\end{equation}

This calculation is performed using Logan William's SL3ME
[[cite:&williams-2022-sl3me]]. Based on absorption spectra obtained from
from [[gls:vasp][VASP]]. This calculation is performed separately for the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] band
gaps and the [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] band gaps, resulting in two synthetic efficiencies

Fig ref:fig:lc_lot_vs presents the lattice parameter comparison of [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]]
calculation and [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] calculations. Full relaxations at both levels of
theory mostly agree on the lattice parameters. At least, any deviation
appears to be very linearly explained. This suggests the accuracy of
[[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] relaxation is enough to optimize most Perovskite samples.

Note this also served as a reasonable validation for our results. A
few samples did have significantly differing lattice parameters. This
prompted checking the optimized structures. We found those Perovskite
structures were substantially deformed and no longer had obvious
octahedral structures. Thus, we exclude these outliers from any
analysis concerned with the dominant pseudo cubic structures which are
the focus of this report.

Fig 2(b) is showing the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] band gap compared to the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] decomposition
energy. It presents the diversity of our Perovskite dataset. The data
sets cover a large range of band gap and decomposition energy. For
example, we have Perovskite with low decomposition energy (good
stability) and suitable band gap value (between 1 eV to 2.5 eV for [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]]
calculations). And we can also find samples with low stability and
large band gap. The distribution of band gap and decomposition energy
shows a great diversity of all Perovskite samples and indicates that
our data set can statistically represent a sufficient Perovskite
space. Fig 2(c) shows the plot of [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] band gaps and [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] decomposition
energy. Since we applied [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] calculations for part of the samples, it
shows some grouping on low decomposition energy. Compared to [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] plot,
more data should be added in high decomposition energy region and
suitable band gap region.

Fig 2(d) presents the [[gls:slme][SLME]] values related to the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] band gap. [[gls:slme][SLME]] is
a proven proxy for photovoltaic performance
[[cite:&yu-2012-ident-poten]]. [[gls:slme][SLME]] measures the absorption efficiency of
light for the Perovskite. As Fig 2(d) showing, a peak around 1.5 eV is
obvious. The peak indicates that these samples with 1.5 eV [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] band
gap will also have best absorption efficiency as photovoltaic
materials. As the band gap increases, the [[gls:slme][SLME]] value decreases and
eventually goes to zero due to the high band gap values.

No target is adequately explained by a single composition or
composition derived axis. But there are helpful relations that aid
understanding the significance of key composition derived descriptors.

A Pearson correlation map is produced to check for strong
relations. Those that exist, when plotted in detail show some
trending, but always with extensive variability. Evidently, an
accurate model will have to be formed on a multidimensional domain.

[[gls:pca][PCA]] is a method of projecting high dimensional data onto a plane
defined by the two linear combinations of axes that explain as much of
the variance as possible.

The method of [[gls:pca][PCA]] is the Singular Value Decomposition, a Unitary
Transform which generalizes the familiar eigendecomposition. [[gls:pca][PCA]] will
"rotate" the N data points in M-D space until their widest 2D cross
section is displayed.

At this point it is readily apparent that this dataset is highly
topological. The data exists on a mostly bounded domain in high
dimensions, so there is some geometry the features constitute.

Our models will prefer to use this this geometric structure in their
explanation for why Perovskite properties vary, this can be useful for
accuracy, it can also be a bias-inducing hindrance.

The synthetic Perovskite data is collected for sampling variety and
without regard for each compound's viability. In order to extract
potentially high-performing candidates for synthesis, we screen all
samples according to certain constraints, thereby obtaining some
Perovskites worth examining with higher Level of Theory [[acrshort:dft][DFT]]
calculations and future physical experiments by brute force. This
dataset can only confidently claim to sample cubic phase
perovskites. Therefore, a promising candidate should have low
deformation. Additionally, a lower decomposition energy combined with
a maximal [[gls:slme][SLME]] value would be ideal for physical testing. Our
screening procedure consists of cutting based on the Deviation from
Cubicity metric, octahedral factor, Goldschmidt tolerance factor,
Bartel tolerance factor, decomposition energy, and band gap -- acting
as less stringent proxy for the [[gls:slme][SLME]] spectrum. The following sections
will discuss the details of each constraint.

*** TODO Deviation from Cubicity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deviation-of-cubicity
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
For all the compositions we tested in our data set, some of them will
have large strain and deformation because of the combination of
elements. For these largely deformed samples, they are no longer remain
a cubic perovskite structure. In this section, we want to analyst how
the structure is apart from the cubic perovskite structure and rule out
these largely deformed samples. Firstly, we need to define deviation of
cubicity. For each perovskite sample, we measure the difference between
b, c lattice parameter against a lattice, showing in Equation X. If the
lattice deviation of cubicity is larger than 10%, we will consider this
perovskite is no longer remain a cubic perovskite and exclude it.
Similarly, we also need to consider 3 angles, , and , to make sure the
angle also remain 90 degrees. We calculated the difference of , and
versus 90 degrees, showing in Equation X, and take this as angular
deviation of cubicity. We also consider the samples that have more than
5% of angular deviation of cubicity are not cubic perovskites and
exclude them. Fig 7 (d) shows the screening results for angle deviation
of cubicity. SI Fig X shows the screening results for b, c lattice and ,
angle. Most of the samples with non-cubic perovskites structures are
organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. A large part of the excluded
samples are A-mixing hybrid perovskites. It indicates that organic
ligands in A site sometimes increase the lattice along some direction
and make the perovskite deformed.

The stability of Perovskite can be predicted by using the atom radius of
all components. There are 3 types of factors are usually considered,
Octahedral factor, tolerance factor, and Bartel tolerance factor. The
formula of these three factors are shown in equation XXX. In our
screening process, we set the criteria for Octahedral factor as 0.442 --
0.895. The criteria for tolerance factor is set to be 0.813 -- 1.107.
The criteria for Bartel tolerance factor is set to be less than 4.18.
Fig 7 (a) shows the Octahedral factor versus decomposition energy plot.
Fig 7 (b) shows the tolerance factor versus decomposition energy plot.
The tolerance factor shows a trend that as the tolerance factor
increases, the decomposition energy decreases. Fig 7 (c) shows the
Bartel tolerance factor versus decomposition energy plot. Within the
criteria of Bartel tolerance factor, the decomposition energy is rapidly
decreased.

The design of this dataset is uniquely suited to the exploration of
alloying effects on Perovskite properties. The combinatorial space of
possible alloys has been sparsely but systematically sampled along
four primary alloy schemes. This sample space affords the opportunity
for a [[gls:qmml][QM/ML]] surrogate model to form the basis of an active learning
strategy which can begin selecting potentially high performing
multi-site alloy candidates based on the current sample set.

For the calculation of future data points obtained by a surrogate
optimizer, we will follow a strategy of performing full structural
optimization at a [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]] level of theory unless circumstances demand
otherwise. This is justified by ref:fig:lc_lot_vs.

Also, we will explore methods for combining the insights of the [[acrshort:pbe][PBE]]
and [[acrshort:hse][HSE]] datasets in training surrogates, e.g. in section
ref:slme-package the two [[gls:slme][SLME]] spectra could be used together to
converge on a physically accurate [[acrshort:pce][PCE]] value.

We anticipate our principal challenge will be in extracting useful
predictor variables from the composition information. The basic
feature sets examined here are highly correlated, but nonetheless show
promise both as a basic screening criterion, and as good classifier
features under [[gls:tsne][t-SNE]] transformation.

Modeling pipelines capable of predicting Perovskite decomposition
energy will likely be very achievable using a transduction and
invertible equivalent of the [[gls:tsne][t-SNE]] algorithm, potentially SONG.

For this reason, kernel learning methods appear to be particularly
promising for high speed optimization of the space.
