* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
The challenge of optimizing Perovskite performance is one with many
facets. Almost every detail of a Perovskite crystal's structure and
chemistry effects its performance as a semiconductor. The size of the
unit cell effects its substrate affinity and in turn its carrier
concentrations. The crystal phase effects many aspects of the
electronic structure, including the band gap and optical response. Of
course, the structure is ultimately dependent on the proportions and
arrangement of the constituent elements.

** Building Perovskite Dataset
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: building-perovskite-dataset
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
The dataset we report is based on standard cubic phase ABX_3
Perovskite structures obtained from public databases. Fourteen common
Perovskite constituents are selected to form our Halide Perovskite
composition space \ref{Fig:outline}. Five constituents including
Methylammonium and Formamidinium cations represent the possible A-site
occupants. Six heavy metal elements represent the possible B-site
occupants. Three halides represent the possible X-site occupants.

Each computational run is performed using a 2x2x2 supercell, this
allows A and B site doping to be modeled in discrete 1/8^th fractions
of the total site occupancy, and it allows X site doping to be modeled
in 1/24^th fractions. At this level, it is appropriate to call these
Perovskites alloys.

The pure (non-alloyed) possibilities are exhaustively sampled using 90
Perovskites. Based on these pure Perovskite structures, we mix
candidates for A, B, and X sites systematically. The alloy space sees
combinatorial scaling and must be sparsely sampled.

To create alloys, for example in B sites, we first select possible B
sites mixing elements.  Then SQS methods are applied to generate
random alloys for given mixing concentrations. Thus, we constructed
126 A-site mixing samples, 151 B-site mixing samples and 127 X-site
mixing samples. The resulting structures are optimized using a DFT
variable-cell relaxation.

** Calculation Details

Simulation Package (VASP) version 6.1. The projector augmented wave
(PAW) potentials were used The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) and (HSE) is used as
exchange-correlation energy. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis
is set to 500 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled by Monkhorst-Pack
k-point mesh, with a reciprocal mesh as 4x4x4. The structural force
convergence threshold is set to be 0.5 eV/Ã….

*** Decomposition Energy
:PROPERTIES:

The decomposition energy indicates the stability of a compound. To
calculate the decomposition energy for ABX3 perovskite, we assume it
will decompose to two phases, AX and BX2. Using DFT calculations, we
can get the optimized energy of a perovskite and that of its
constituent phases.

The equation is presenting the details calculation for decomposition
energy. For PBE decomposition energy, we use DFT energy results from
PBE level calculation. For HSE decomposition energy, we use the energy
from HSE level calculations.

*** Lattice constant PBE vs HSE
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lattice-constant-pbe-vs-hse
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
Fig 2(a) presents the lattice parameter comparison of PBE calculation
and HSE calculations. Most of the samples have close HSE lattice
parameters and PBE lattice parameters. This indicates that the accuracy
of PBE on lattice and structure is enough for most of the perovskite
samples. Some samples are observed significantly different lattice
parameters. By checking the optimized structures, we found that the
perovskite structure is largely deformed and no longer keep the
octahedral structures. Thus, we removed these 3 points for following
analysis.

*** Decomposition energy vs band gap PBE and HSE
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: decomposition-energy-vs-band-gap-pbe-and-hse
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
Fig 2(b) is showing the PBE band gap compared to the PBE decomposition
energy. It presents the diversity of our perovskite dataset. The data
sets cover a large range of band gap and decomposition energy. For
example, we have perovskite with low decomposition energy (good
stability) and suitable band gap value (between 1 eV to 2.5 eV for PBE
calculations). And we can also find samples with low stability and large
band gap. The distribution of band gap and decomposition energy shows a
great diversity of all perovskite samples and indicates that our data
set can statistically represent a sufficient perovskite space. Fig 2(c)
shows the plot of HSE band gaps and HSE decomposition energy. Since we
applied HSE calculations for part of the samples, it shows some grouping
on low decomposition energy. Compared to PBE plot, more data should be
added in high decomposition energy region and suitable band gap region.

*** Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) vs PBE Band gap
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: spectroscopic-limited-maximum-efficiency-slme-vs-pbe-band-gap
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
Fig 2(d) presents the Spectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME)
values related to the PBE band gap. Spectroscopic Limited Maximum
Efficiency (SLME) is a very important properties for photovoltaic
performance. SLME measures the absorption efficiency of light for the
perovskite. As Fig 2(d) showing, a peak around 1.5 eV is obvious. The
peak indicates that these samples with 1.5 eV PBE band gap will also
have best absorption efficiency as photovoltaic materials. As the band
gap increases, the SLME value decreases and eventually goes to zero due
to the high band gap values.

It is unlikely that any of the targets is fully explained by a single
composition or composition derived axis. But there are helpful relations
that aid in obtaining a physical understanding.

as in a Pearson correlation map is produced to check for strong
relations. Those that exist, when plotted in detail show some trending,
but always with extensive variability. Evidently, an accurate model will
have to be formed on a multidimensional domain.

** PCA

#+CAPTION: PCA
[[file:comp_ratio_projection_annot.png]]

Principal Component Analysis is a method of projecting high dimensional
data onto a plane defined by the two linear combinations of axes that
explain as much of the variance as possible.

The method of PCA is the Singular Value Decomposition, a Unitary
Transform which generalizes the familiar eigendecomposition. PCA will
"rotate" the N data points in M-D space until their widest 2D cross
section is displayed.

At this point it is readily apparent that this dataset is highly
topological. The data exists on a mostly bounded domain in high
dimensions, so there is some geometry the features constitute.

Our models will prefer to use this this geometric structure in their
explanation for why perovskite properties vary, this can be useful for
accuracy, it can also be a bias-inducing hindrance.

The synthetic Perovskite data is collected for sampling variety and
without regard for each compound's viability. In order to extract
potentially high-performing candidates for synthesis, we screen all
samples according to certain constraints, thereby obtaining some
Perovskites worth examining with higher Level of Theory DFT
calculations and future physical experiments by brute force. This
dataset can only confidently claim to sample cubic phase
perovskites. Therefore, a promising candidate should have low
deformation. Additionally, a lower decomposition energy combined with
a maximal SLME value would be ideal for physical testing. Our
screening procedure consists of cutting based on the Deviation from
Cubicity metric, octahedral factor, Goldschmidt tolerance factor,
Bartel tolerance factor, decomposition energy, and band gap -- acting
as less stringent proxy for the SLME spectrum. The following sections
will discuss the details of each constraint.

*** Deviation from Cubicity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deviation-of-cubicity
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
For all the compositions we tested in our data set, some of them will
have large strain and deformation because of the combination of
elements. For these largely deformed samples, they are no longer remain
a cubic perovskite structure. In this section, we want to analyst how
the structure is apart from the cubic perovskite structure and rule out
these largely deformed samples. Firstly, we need to define deviation of
cubicity. For each perovskite sample, we measure the difference between
b, c lattice parameter against a lattice, showing in Equation X. If the
lattice deviation of cubicity is larger than 10%, we will consider this
perovskite is no longer remain a cubic perovskite and exclude it.
Similarly, we also need to consider 3 angles, , and , to make sure the
angle also remain 90 degrees. We calculated the difference of , and
versus 90 degrees, showing in Equation X, and take this as angular
deviation of cubicity. We also consider the samples that have more than
5% of angular deviation of cubicity are not cubic perovskites and
exclude them. Fig 7 (d) shows the screening results for angle deviation
of cubicity. SI Fig X shows the screening results for b, c lattice and ,
angle. Most of the samples with non-cubic perovskites structures are
organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites. A large part of the excluded
samples are A-mixing hybrid perovskites. It indicates that organic
ligands in A site sometimes increase the lattice along some direction
and make the perovskite deformed.

*** Octahedral factor, tolerance factor, and Bartel tolerance factor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: octahedral-factor-tolerance-factor-and-bartel-tolerance-factor
:CLASS: unnumbered
:END:
The stability of perovskite can be predicted by using the atom radius of
all components. There are 3 types of factors are usually considered,
Octahedral factor, tolerance factor, and Bartel tolerance factor. The
formula of these three factors are shown in equation XXX. In our
screening process, we set the criteria for Octahedral factor as 0.442 --
0.895. The criteria for tolerance factor is set to be 0.813 -- 1.107.
The criteria for Bartel tolerance factor is set to be less than 4.18.
Fig 7 (a) shows the Octahedral factor versus decomposition energy plot.
Fig 7 (b) shows the tolerance factor versus decomposition energy plot.
The tolerance factor shows a trend that as the tolerance factor
increases, the decomposition energy decreases. Fig 7 (c) shows the
Bartel tolerance factor versus decomposition energy plot. Within the
criteria of Bartel tolerance factor, the decomposition energy is rapidly
decreased.

The design of this dataset is uniquely suited to the exploration of
alloying effects on Perovskite properties. The combinatorial space of
possible alloys has been sparsely but systematically sampled along
four primary alloy schemes. This sample space affords the opportunity
for a QM/ML surrogate model to form the basis of an active learning
strategy which can begin selecting potentially high performing
multi-site alloy candidates based on the current sample set.

The principal challenge will be in extracting features useful as
performance features. The basic feature sets examined here are highly
correlated, but nonetheless show promise as basic screening criterion.

Modeling pipelines capable of predicting Perovskite decomposition
energy will likely be very achievable using a transductive and
invertible equivalent of the tSNE algorithm, potentially SONG.
