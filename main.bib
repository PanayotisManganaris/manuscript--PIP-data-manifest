                  perovskites presents new opportunities for
                  optoelectronic applications as well as significant
                  challenges associated with exploring combinatorial
                  chemical spaces. In this work{,} we develop a
                  framework powered by high-throughput computations
                  and machine learning for the design and prediction
                  of mixed cation halide perovskite alloys. In a
                  chemical space of ABX3 perovskites with a selected
                  set of options for A{,} B{,} and X species{,}
                  pseudo-cubic structures with B-site mixing are
                  simulated using density functional theory (DFT) and
                  several properties are computed{,} including
                  stability{,} lattice constant{,} band gap{,} vacancy
                  formation energy{,} refractive index{,} and optical
                  absorption spectrum{,} using both semi-local and
                  hybrid functionals. Neural networks (NN) are used to
                  train predictive models for every property using
                  tabulated elemental properties of A{,} B{,} and X
                  site species as descriptors. Starting from a DFT
                  dataset of 229 points{,} we use the trained NN
                  models to predict the structural{,} energetic{,}
                  electronic{,} and optical properties of an extensive
                  dataset of 17 955 compounds{,} and perform
                  high-throughput screening in terms of stability{,}
                  band gap{,} and defect tolerance{,} to obtain 392
                  promising compounds that are ranked as potential
                  absorbers according to their photovoltaic figure of
                  merit. Compositional trends in the screened set of
                  attractive mixed cation halide perovskites are
                  revealed and additional computations are performed
                  on selected compounds. The data-driven design
                  framework developed here is promising for designing
                  novel mixed compositions and can be extended to a
                  wider perovskite chemical space in terms of A{,}
                  B{,} and X species{,} different kinds of mixing at
                  the A{,} B{,} or X sites{,} non-cubic phases{,} and
                  other properties of interest.",
